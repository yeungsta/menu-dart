Hey there @Model.Email,
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
We just want to let you know that your Menu Dart 30-day free trial has expired. 

@if (Model.DeactivatedMenus.Count() > 0)
{
    <text>
    Your mobile menu(s) have been deactivated and no longer viewable by your customers:
    <p style="margin-bottom:1em">
    </text>
    
    foreach (var item in Model.DeactivatedMenus)
    {
         @item.MenuName<text><br></text>
    }
    
    <text>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1em">
    Remember, you can always re-activate your menu(s) anytime at MenuDart.com.
    </text>
}
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
Menu Dart is still only $7 a month! Start immediately by signing in and activating your menu.
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
Happy to serve you,
<br>
Your Friends at Menu Dart
