<h2>Hey there @Model.Email,</h2>
<p>
We just want to let you know that your MenuDart 30-day free trial is expiring in a few days! 

@if (Model.DeactivatedMenus.Count() > 0)
{
    <text>
    Should you allow your trial to expire, your mobile menu(s) will be deactivated and no longer viewable by your customers:
    <p>
    </text>
    
    foreach (var item in Model.DeactivatedMenus)
    {
         @item.MenuName<text> (</text>@item.MenuLink<text>) <br></text>
    }
}
<p>
Keep your mobile menu activated today! MenuDart is still only $7 a month; Start immediately by signing in and activating your menu.
<p>
Happy to serve you,
<br>
Your Friends at MenuDart
